"History" is an&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Umbrella term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_term">umbrella term</a>&nbsp;that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called&nbsp;<a title="Historian" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian">historians</a>.</p>
<p>History also includes the&nbsp;<a title="Discipline (academia)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(academia)">academic discipline</a>&nbsp;which uses a&nbsp;<a title="Narrative" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative">narrative</a>&nbsp;to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.<sup id="cite_ref-evans1_5-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-evans1-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;Historians sometimes debate the&nbsp;<a title="Historiography" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography">nature of history</a>&nbsp;and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on the problems of the present.<sup id="cite_ref-evans1_5-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-evans1-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tosh1_7-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-Tosh1-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding&nbsp;<a title="King Arthur" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur">King Arthur</a>), are usually classified as&nbsp;<a title="Cultural heritage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage">cultural heritage</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Legend" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend">legends</a>, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Low1_11-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#cite_note-Low1-11">[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;<a title="Herodotus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, a 5th-century BC&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Greek historiography" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_historiography">Greek historian</a>&nbsp;is often considered within the Western tradition to be the "father of history", or by some the "father of lies", and, along with his contemporary&nbsp;<a title="Thucydides" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state&nbsp;<a title="Chronicle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle">chronicle</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Spring and Autumn Annals" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals">Spring and Autumn Annals</a>, was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.</p>
<p>Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a&nbsp;<a title="Outline of academic disciplines" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines#History">major discipline</a>&nbsp;in university studies.</p>
